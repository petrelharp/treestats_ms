  abstract = {We outline a general coalescent framework for using genotype data in linkage disequilibrium-based mapping studies. Our approach unifies two main goals of gene mapping that have generally been treated separately in the past: detecting association (i.e., significance testing) and estimating the location of the causative variation. To tackle the problem, we separate the inference into two stages. First, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior distribution of coalescent genealogies of all the sampled chromosomes without regard to phenotype. Then, averaging across genealogies, we estimate the likelihood of the phenotype data under various models for mutation and penetrance at an unobserved disease locus. The essential signal that these models look for is that in the presence of disease susceptibility variants in a region, there is nonrandom clustering of the chromosomes on the tree according to phenotype. The extent of nonrandom clustering is captured by the likelihood and can be used to construct significance tests or Bayesian posterior distributions for location. A novelty of our framework is that it can naturally accommodate quantitative data. We describe applications of the method to simulated data and to data from a Mendelian locus (CFTR, responsible for cystic fibrosis) and from a proposed complex trait locus (calpain-10, implicated in type 2 diabetes).},

  abstract = {Large-scale association studies are being undertaken with the hope of uncovering the genetic determinants of complex disease. We describe a computationally efficient method for inferring genealogies from population genotype data and show how these genealogies can be used to fine map disease loci and interpret association signals. These genealogies take the form of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). The ARG defines a genealogical tree for each locus, and, as one moves along the chromosome, the topologies of consecutive trees shift according to the impact of historical recombination events. There are two stages to our analysis. First, we infer plausible ARGs, using a heuristic algorithm, which can handle unphased and missing data and is fast enough to be applied to large-scale studies. Second, we test the genealogical tree at each locus for a clustering of the disease cases beneath a branch, suggesting that a causative mutation occurred on that branch. Since the true ARG is unknown, we average this analysis over an ensemble of inferred ARGs. We have characterized the performance of our method across a wide range of simulated disease models. Compared with simpler tests, our method gives increased accuracy in positioning untyped causative loci and can also be used to estimate the frequencies of untyped causative alleles. We have applied our method to Ueda et al.’s association study of CTLA4 and Graves disease, showing how it can be used to dissect the association signal, giving potentially interesting results of allelic heterogeneity and interaction. Similar approaches analyzing an ensemble of ARGs inferred using our method may be applicable to many other problems of inference from population genotype data.},

@article{ralph2019empirical,
  abstract = {Inference with population genetic data usually treats the population pedigree as a nuisance parameter, the unobserved product of a past history of random mating. However, the history of genetic relationships in a given population is a fixed, unobserved object, and so an alternative approach is to treat this network of relationships as a complex object we wish to learn about, by observing how genomes have been noisily passed down through it. This paper explores this point of view, showing how to translate questions about population genetic data into calculations with a Poisson process of mutations on all ancestral genomes. This method is applied to give a robust interpretation to the f4 statistic used to identify admixture, and to design a new statistic that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common ancestor between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets population genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions over ancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly interpretable interpretations for these statistics. This provides a method for describing demographic history without simplified demographic models. More generally, it brings into focus the population pedigree, which is averaged over in model-based demographic inference.},

Each of these two classifications of mutations is analogous to allelic types in a sample of genes.

Simulations of a two-locus model and a four-locus model were also carried out to determine the effect of intragenic recombination on the homozygosity test of Watterson (Genetics 85, 789-814; 88, 405-417) and on the number of unique alleles in a sample.

That simplifies the analysis of models of subdivided populations because the average coalescence time can be found by computing separately the time it takes for two genes to enter a single subpopulation and time it takes for two genes in the same subpopulation to coalesce. The first time depends only on the migration matrix and the second time depends only on the total number of individuals in the population. This approach is used to find FST in the finite island model and in one- and two-dimensional stepping-stone models. It is also used to find the rate of approach of FST to its equilibrium value. These results are discussed in terms of different measures of genetic distance. It is proposed that, for the purposes of describing the amount of gene flow among local populations, the effective migration rate between pairs of local populations, M, which is the migration rate that would be estimated for those two populations if they were actually in an island model, provides a simple and useful measure of genetic similarity that can be defined for either allozyme or DNA sequence data.},

We have developed a non-parametric approach for estimating the date of origin of genetic variants in large-scale sequencing data sets. The accuracy and robustness of the approach is demonstrated through simulation. Using data from two publicly available human genomic diversity resources, we estimated the age of more than 45 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome and release the Atlas of Variant Age as a public online database. We characterize the relationship between variant age and frequency in different geographical regions, and demonstrate the value of age information in interpreting variants of functional and selective importance. Finally, we use allele age estimates to power a rapid approach for inferring the ancestry shared between individual genomes, to quantify genealogical relationships at different points in the past, as well as describe and explore the evolutionary history of modern human populations.},

However, current methods are limited, and the most accurate techniques are able to process no more than a hundred samples. As datasets that consist of millions of genomes are now being collected, there is a need for scalable and efficient inference methods to fully utilize these resources. Here we introduce an algorithm that is able to not only infer whole-genome histories with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art but also process four orders of magnitude more sequences. The approach also provides an ‘evolutionary encoding’ of the data, enabling efficient calculation of relevant statistics. We apply the method to human data from the 1000 Genomes Project, Simons Genome Diversity Project and UK Biobank, showing that the inferred genealogies are rich in biological signal and efficient to process.},

@article{charlesworth1997effects,
  abstract = {Levels of neutral genetic diversity in populations subdivided into two demes were studied by multilocus stochastic simulations. The model includes deleterious mutations at loci throughout the genome, causing 'background selection', as well as a single locus at which a polymorphism is maintained, either by frequency-dependent selection or by local selective differences. These balanced polymorphisms induce long coalescence times at linked neutral loci, so that sequence diversity at these loci is enhanced at statistical equilibrium. We study how equilibrium neutral diversity levels are affected by the degree of population subdivision, the presence or absence of background selection, and the level of inbreeding of the population. The simulation results are compared with approximate analytical formulae, assuming the infinite sites neutral model. We discuss how balancing selection can be distinguished from local selection, by determining whether peaks of diversity in the region of the polymorphic locus are seen within or between demes. The width of such diversity peaks is shown to depend on the total species population size, rather than local deme sizes. We show that, with population subdivision, local selection enhances between-deme diversity even at neutral sites distant from the polymorphic locus, producing higher FST values than with no selection; very high values can be generated at sites close to a selected locus. Background selection also increases FST, mainly because of decreased diversity within populations, which implies that its effects may be distinguishable from those of local selection. Both effects are stronger in selfing than outcrossing populations. Linkage disequilibrium between neutral sites is generated by both balancing and local selection, especially in selfing populations, because of linkage disequilibrium between the neutral sites and the selectively maintained alleles. We discuss how these theoretical results can be related to data on genetic diversity within and between local populations of a species.},

@article{hudson1994levels,
  abstract = {Different regions of the Drosophila genome have very different rates of recombination. For example, near centromeres and near the tips of chromosomes, the rates of recombination are much lower than in other regions. Several surveys of polymorphisms in Drosophila have now documented that levels of DNA polymorphism are positively correlated with rates of recombination; i.e., regions with low rates of recombination tend to have low levels of DNA polymorphism within populations of Drosophila. Three hypotheses are reviewed that might account for these observations. The first hypothesis is that regions of low recombination have low neutral mutation rates. Under this hypothesis between-species divergences should also be low in regions of low recombination. In fact, regions of low recombination have diverged at the same rate as other regions of the genome. On this basis, this strictly neutral hypothesis is rejected. The second hypothesis is that the process of fixation of favorable mutations leads to the observed correlation between polymorphism and recombination. This occurs via genetic hitchhiking, in which linked regions of the genome are swept along with the selectively favored mutant as it increases in frequency and eventually fixes in the population. This hitchhiking model with fixation of favorable mutations is compatible with major features of the data. By assuming this model is correct, one can estimate the rate of fixation of favorable mutations. The third hypothesis is that selection against continually arising deleterious mutations results in reduced levels of polymorphism at linked loci. Analysis of this background selection model shows that it can produce some reduction in levels of polymorphism but cannot explain some extreme cases that have been observed. Thus, it appears that hitchhiking of favorable mutations and background selection against deleterious mutations must be considered together to correctly account for the patterns of polymorphism that are observed in Drosophila.},

Analysing ∼17 million single-nucleotide variants from the genomes of 652 tumours, we show that regional autosomal mutation rates at megabase resolution are largely stable across cancer types, with differences related to changes in replication timing and gene expression. However, mutations arising after the inactivation of MMR are no longer enriched in late replicating heterochromatin relative to early replicating euchromatin. Thus, differential DNA repair and not differential mutation supply is the primary cause of the large-scale regional mutation rate variation across the human genome.},

@article{galloway2019stickleback,
  abstract = {Threespine stickleback populations provide a striking example of local adaptation to divergent habitats in populations that are connected by recurrent gene flow. These small fish occur in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and in numerous cases the smaller freshwater populations have been established {\textquotedblleft}de novo{\textquotedblright} from marine colonists. Independently evolved freshwater populations show similar phenotypes that have been shown to derive largely from the same standing genetic variants. Geographic isolation prevents direct migration between the freshwater populations, strongly suggesting that these shared locally adaptive alleles are transported through the marine population. However it is still largely unknown how gene flow, recombination, and selection jointly impact the standing variation that might fuel this adaptation. Here we use individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to determine the levels of gene flow that best match observed patterns of allele sharing among habitats in stickleback. We aim to better understand how gene flow and local adaptation in large metapopulations determine the speed of adaptation and re-use of standing genetic variation. In our simulations we find that repeated adaptation uses a shared set of alleles that are maintained at low frequency by migration-selection balance in oceanic populations. This process occurs over a realistic range of intermediate levels of gene flow that match previous empirical population genomic studies in stickleback. Examining these simulations more deeply reveals how lower levels of gene flow leads to slow, independent adaptation to different habitats, whereas higher levels gene flow leads to significant mutation load {\textendash} but an increased probability of successful population genomic scans for locally adapted alleles. Surprisingly, we find that the genealogical origins of most freshwater adapted alleles can be traced back to the original generation of marine individuals that colonized the lakes, as opposed to subsequent migrants. These simulations provide deeper context for existing studies of stickleback evolutionary genomics, and guidance for future empirical studies in this model. More broadly, our results support existing theory of local adaptation but extend it by more completely documenting the genealogical history of adaptive alleles in a metapopulation.},

How do they move and interbreed across the landscape? How were they moving a thousand years ago, and where were the ancestors of a particular individual alive today? Answers to these questions can have profound consequences for our understanding of history, ecology, and the evolutionary process. In this review, we discuss how geographic aspects of the distribution, movement, and reproduction of organisms are reflected in their pedigree across space and time. Because the structure of the pedigree is what determines patterns of relatedness in modern genetic variation, our aim is to thus provide intuition for how these processes leave an imprint in genetic data.

  abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of maintaining information about graphs with history -- so called graph timeline. A graph timeline is a sequence of graphs G1,..., Gt, in which consecutive graphs are obtained from previous ones by small modifications, e.g., by adding or removing a single edge. We aim to devise algorithms that after some preprocessing are able to efficiently answer queries about the existence of paths in the entire timeline of the graph, or within some time interval. We consider two types of queries: [forall (u,v,a,b)] --- query that checks if there exists a path from u to v in each of Ga,..., Gb; [exists(u,v,a,b)] --- query that checks if there exists a path from u to v in any of Ga,...,Gb. Our study is motivated by the recent intensive study of the evolution of graphs, and the question whether information about history can be efficiently aggregated. We show that for path queries this is, somewhat astonishingly, true. In some cases it is possible to preprocess graph timeline and answer such queries in almost optimal time. First, we consider undirected graphs and timelines in which two consecutive graphs differ by addition or removal of a single edge. We show a randomized algorithm that requires O(t log t log log t log n+m) preprocessing time and answers forall queries in O(log n log log t) time. Here, $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph and m is the number of permanent edges, that is edges common to all graphs in the timeline. This algorithm can be derandomized at some cost in the running time. Second, we give a deterministic algorithm that needs O(nt+m) preprocessing and answers exists queries in O(1) time. Finally, for directed graphs, we consider timelines where two consecutive graphs differ by addition or removal of a set of edges incident to one vertex. In this case we, are able to propose a randomized algorithm that after O(nω-1t) preprocessing time can answer exists(u,v,a,b) queries in O(n) time and forall(u,v,a,b) queries in O(n+b-a) time.},

The algorithm takes time O(k log n) for a sequence of k updates to a graph of n vertices, giving a bound of O(log n) on the average time per update. We use our techniques to solve the offline geometric MST problem for a planar point set subject to insertions and deletions; our algorithm for this problem takes time O(k log2n), for an average of O(log2n) time per update.

  abstract = {A major goal of population genetics has b een to determine the extent by which selection at linked sites influences patterns of neutral nucleotide di versity in the genome . Multiple lines of evidence suggest that diversity is influenced by both positive and negative selection . For example, in many species there are troughs in diversity surrounding functional genomic elements , consistent with the action of either background selection (BGS) or selective sweeps . In this study, we investigated the causes of the diversity troughs that are observed in the wild house mouse genome . Using the unfolded si te frequency spectrum (uSFS) , we estimated the strength and frequencies of deleterious and advantageous mutations occurring in different func tional elements in the genome. We then used t hese estimates to param eteriz e forward - in - time simulations of chromosomes, using realistic distributions of functional elements and recombination rate variation in order to determine if selection at linked sites can explain the observed patterns of nucleotide diversity.  The simu lations suggest that BGS alone cannot explain the dips in diversity around either exons or conserved non - coding elements (CNEs) .  A combination of BGS and s elective sweeps produce s deeper dips in diversity than BGS alone , but the inferred parameters of sele ction cannot fully explain the patterns observed in the genome .  O ur results provide evidence of sweeps shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity across the mouse genome , and also suggest that infrequent, strongly advantageous mutations play an important rol e in this.  The limitations of using the uSFS for inferring the frequency and effects of advantageous mutations are discussed.},

@article{haenel2018metaanalysis,
  abstract = {Abstract Understanding the distribution of crossovers along chromosomes is crucial to evolutionary genomics because the crossover rate determines how strongly a genome region is influenced by natural selection on linked sites. Nevertheless, generalities in the chromosome-scale distribution of crossovers have not been investigated formally. We fill this gap by synthesizing joint information on genetic and physical maps across 62 animal, plant and fungal species. Our quantitative analysis reveals a strong and taxonomically widespread reduction of the crossover rate in the centre of chromosomes relative to their peripheries. We demonstrate that this pattern is poorly explained by the position of the centromere, but find that the magnitude of the relative reduction in the crossover rate in chromosome centres increases with chromosome length. That is, long chromosomes often display a dramatically low crossover rate in their centre, whereas short chromosomes exhibit a relatively homogeneous crossover rate. This observation is compatible with a model in which crossover is initiated from the chromosome tips, an idea with preliminary support from mechanistic investigations of meiotic recombination. Consequently, we show that organisms achieve a higher genome-wide crossover rate by evolving smaller chromosomes. Summarizing theory and providing empirical examples, we finally highlight that taxonomically widespread and systematic heterogeneity in crossover rate along chromosomes generates predictable broad-scale trends in genetic diversity and population differentiation by modifying the impact of natural selection among regions within a genome. We conclude by emphasizing that chromosome-scale heterogeneity in crossover rate should urgently be incorporated into analytical tools in evolutionary genomics, and in the interpretation of resulting patterns.},

We present a method for detection of recent IBD in population samples. Our method accounts for linkage disequilibrium between SNPs to enable full use of high-density SNP data. We find that our method can detect segments of a length of 2 cM with moderate power and negligible false discovery rate in Illumina 550K data in Northwestern Europeans. We compare our method with GERMLINE and PLINK, and we show that our method has a level of resolution that is significantly better than these existing methods, thus extending the usefulness of recent IBD in analysis of high-density SNP data. We survey four genomic regions in a sample of UK individuals of European descent and find that on average, at a given location, our method detects IBD in 2.7 per 10,000 pairs of individuals in Illumina 550K data. We also present methodology and results for detection of homozygosity by descent (HBD) and survey the whole genome in a sample of 1373 UK individuals of European descent. We detect HBD in 4.7 individuals per 10,000 on average at a given location. Our methodology is implemented in the freely available BEAGLE software package.},

vidual. Thus we can consider the coalescent tree at a locus as a stochastic process on a fixed pedigree, making “coin
toss” decisions between the maternal and paternal chromosomes of each ancestor that is reached (Figure 2). Features
of a more extensive pedigree, such as population structure, generate genome-wide influences on the coalescent distri-
butions. This effect is evident in genome-wide association studies, where population structure and cryptic relatedness
(pedigree effects) alter the genome-wide distribution of single-SNP association statistics. 28 Coalescent modelling usu-
ally ignores the pedigree because it is rarely observed and is difficult to infer. However, pedigree effects are not always

@article{aguillon2017deconstructing,
  abstract = {Author summary Dispersal is a fundamental component of the life history of most organisms and therefore influences many biological processes. Dispersal is particularly important in creating genetic structure on the landscape. We often observe a pattern of decreased genetic relatedness between individuals as geographic distances increases, or isolation-by-distance. This pattern is particularly pronounced in organisms with extremely short dispersal distances. Despite the ubiquity of isolation-by-distance patterns in nature, there are few examples that explicitly demonstrate how limited dispersal influences spatial genetic structure. Here we investigate the processes that result in spatial genetic structure using the Florida Scrub-Jay, a bird with extremely limited dispersal behavior and extensive genome-wide data. We take advantage of the long-term monitoring of a contiguous population of Florida Scrub-Jays, which has resulted in a detailed pedigree and measurements of dispersal for hundreds of individuals. We show how limited dispersal results in close genealogical relatives living closer together geographically, which generates a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance at an extremely small spatial scale (<10 km) in just a few generations. Given the detailed dispersal, pedigree, and genomic data, we can achieve a fairly complete understanding of how dispersal shapes patterns of genetic diversity over short spatial scales.},
